to use Lasagne, instead of focusing on writing maximally modular and reusable

# mini-batches of a particular size, optionally in random order. It assumes
# data is available as numpy arrays. For big datasets, you could load numpy
# arrays as memory-mapped files (np.load(..., mmap_mode='r')), or write your
# own custom data iteration function. For small datasets, you can also copy
# them to GPU at once for slightly improved performance. This would involve
# several changes in the main program, though, and is not demonstrated here.
